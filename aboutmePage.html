            <h1>Carlos</h1>
            <p>Hey world! This is Carlos' very first site from scratch. That been said I introduce myself to everyone: My name as you may seen it's Carlos Gil. I'm currently self-teaching (if that's a word) HTML and CSS so it there is something I'm missisng or someting I can inprove on please —pretty please!— let me know.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>On the other hand I am 28 years old and I like tons of stuff. I'll just put a list here of my hobbies and stuff:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create lofi music is one of my stuff. I do really like creating music and to listen to for sure. I don't have a favorite music genre tho. I like all sort of music.</li>
                <li>I like to play videogames especially mobile games beacuse I think they have a lot of potential but nobody cares.</li>
                <li>I like to read. Must of the time I read on Kindle beacuse I find difficult to concentrate on a book due to their small letters and plain text. On Kindle I've installed a font which makes me read "faster" (I've ADHD so it's really a challenge to read on a book or read. period.)</li>
                <li>I like to write fiction. Down here there is a link to my wordpress blog. That blog is the one that made me want to study front-end. That and the payment they say it's really high up. But how knows and who cares? Not me for sure.</li>
                <li>I like to spend time with <em>Hércules</em> (must be read in spanish) my handsome dog.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yeah, I think thats it.You can get to know me base on that.</p>
            <h2>My job(s)</h2>
            <p>I have being working as an Online English Teacher for a year and probably I'll be working next month on a school downtown.
            </p>
            <p>And that is for this part really. I have dedicated my adult live on teaching. I have being an English Teacher for 5 years now.</p>
