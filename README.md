# 01-portfolio
Here you will see some of the pages I have been working on for the past few days. I just started working on *_HTML_* AND *_CSS_* so feel free to comment on my work because so far I know I got a lot to learn and a lot to discover.

NOTE:
My further repositories will be numbered for their relevance and the time I spend (working) on them. That being said this is number 01 because I will be working on it most of the time. Of course there will be more projects with the same or more relevance than my portfolio and in those cases they will be listed on the top 03.
Without further ado, peace out!
